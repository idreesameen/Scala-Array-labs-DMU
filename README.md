# Scala Arrays Examples

This repository contains a collection of Scala programs that demonstrate how to work with arrays in Scala. The examples cover a variety of use cases, including basic array operations, multidimensional arrays, and more advanced array manipulations. These examples are designed to help beginners and intermediate Scala developers understand how to effectively use arrays in their programs.

## Introduction

Arrays are a fundamental data structure in programming, and Scala provides powerful tools to work with them. This repository contains a set of Scala programs that showcase different ways to use arrays, including:

- Basic array creation and manipulation
- Multidimensional arrays
- Array traversal and searching
- Pattern generation using arrays
- Error handling with arrays

These examples are open-source and free to use for learning purposes.

## Examples Overview

Hereâ€™s a brief description of each file in the repository:

1. **DynamicArrays.scala**  
   Demonstrates basic array operations, including summing elements, finding the smallest/largest values, and counting negative numbers.

2. **EvenIndex.scala**  
   Prints elements at even indices of an array.

3. **Fibonacci.scala**  
   Generates and prints the first 40 numbers in the Fibonacci sequence using an array.

4. **LettersMatch.scala**  
   Counts the occurrences of vowels, consonants, and non-alphabetic characters entered by the user.

5. **Lottery1.scala** & **Lottery2.scala**  
   Visualize lottery numbers using arrays and simple text-based graphics.

6. **MultiDimensionalReverse.scala**  
   Reverses and prints a 2D array (matrix) in reverse order.

7. **MultiDimensionalTimesTable.scala**  
   Generates and prints a multiplication table using a 2D array.

8. **OddIndex.scala**  
   Prints elements at odd indices of an array in reverse order.

9. **Pattern.scala**  
   Generates and prints patterns using a 2D array of characters.

10. **ProcessingArrays2.scala**  
    Reads strings from the user and stores them in an array, then prints them.

11. **TryCatchFinally.scala**  
    Demonstrates error handling (try-catch-finally) when working with arrays.

12. **UsingArray2.scala** & **UsingArray3.scala**  
    Additional examples of array usage (details to be added based on content).

13. **Words.scala**  
    (Description to be added based on content).

## How to Run the Examples

To run the examples, follow these steps:

1. **Install Scala**: Ensure you have Scala installed on your system. You can download it from the [official Scala website](https://www.scala-lang.org/download/).

2. **Clone the Repository**:  
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/scala-arrays-examples.git
   cd scala-arrays-examples
   ```

3. **Compile and Run**:  
   Use the `scalac` command to compile the Scala files and `scala` to run them. For example:
   ```bash
   scalac DynamicArrays.scala
   scala DynamicArrays
   ```

4. **Explore and Modify**: Feel free to modify the code and experiment with different array operations.
